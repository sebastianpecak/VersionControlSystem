# VersionControlSystem
Educational version of GIT. Own implementation.

Project started out with diff tool, which I wanted to create.
Basically diff tool, just like in GIT version control system, is responsible for providing version control system
and end-user with all information about changes between 2 files (in this sense I mean file's versions).

Next setp is creating versioning system based on diff tool.
Progress of my work will be published here: https://github.com/sebastianpecak/VersionControlSystem.
